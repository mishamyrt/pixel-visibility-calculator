# Pixel Visibility Calculator

A browser-based application that allows you to calculate the necessary resolution for comfortable viewing of content.

For example, if you want to buy a 4K TV, and all calculations show that you will not see the difference with 1080p, you can save money.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
